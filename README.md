# The OpenRTX project

OpenRTX is a free and open source firmware for digital ham radios created and maintained by:

* Niccol√≤ Izzo IU2KIN n@izzo.sh
* Silvano Seva IU2KWO silseva@fastwebnet.it
* Federico Amedeo Izzo IU2NUO federico@izzo.pro
* Frederik Saraci IU2NRO frederik.saraci@gmail.com

The firmware is designed with a top-down approach with the objectives of modularity, flexibility and high performance.\
Currently, it targets the following devices:

* Tytera MD-380/390
* Tytera MD-UV380/390
* Tytera TYT MD-9600
* Radioddity GD-77
* Baofeng DM-1801
* M17 project's Module17


The development status of the project is summarised in [this page](platforms.md), while all the source code is available on the OpenRTX's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenRTX/OpenRTX).

A guide on how to flash the firmware on your device is available in [users' guide](user_guide.md) page, while the [developers' page](developers_guide.md) contains information about how to set up the compilation toolchain, as well as some details about the firmware's internal structure.

If you are interested in keeping updated with the latest news or you want to join the community chat, you can find all the coordinates in [dedicated page](get_in_touch.md).

#### Acknowledgments:

All this was made possible by the huge reverse engineering effort of Travis Goodspeed and of all the contributors of [md380tools](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools), which provided a valuable starting point when we moved our first steps with the MD-380.

Thanks to Roger Clark VK3KYY and all the contributors of the [OpenGD77](http://opengd77.com/) project which both inspired this project and, as a precursor, provided a working code example for the GD77 radio family.

A warm thank goes also to SP5WWP and the [M17](https://m17project.org) community for support given during the long process of implementing the M17 protocol in our firmware.

Also thanks for donating hardware to the project to:
* M17 Project
* laurivosandi
* Ronald PD1ACF

And, last but not least, thanks to everyone who donated via [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/OpenRTX/donate).
