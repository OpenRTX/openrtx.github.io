## Memory Map

The memory map of the device is very well described in the [datasheet](https://www.gigadevice.com/microcontroller/gd32f303vgt6/). The firmware itself starts at 0x8004000 instead of 0x8000000 as the first 0x4000 bytes are taken by the bootloader.

## Flashing

Someone build some python [scripts to flash Anytone devices](https://github.com/reald/anytone-flash-tools) based on a analysis of the USB traffic. They are a good source to validate findings from the reverse engineering process.

At the moment there is no update security like encryption or app signing implemented. Updates can be written to the device without any additional effort using the \x01 command.

### MCU Flash

To write to the MCU flash the device needs to be set into bootloader mode. This mode is indicated by a blinking red LED and allows writing to the MCU flash.

The MCU flash holds the bootloader, the main application and some important data.

### Internal Flash Memory

If the device is put into *PROGRAM* mode, it is possible to read and write the external flash with the R and W commands. The MCU flash itself is not readable. This can be done via the running application and it does not require bootloader mode or any other special condition.

The internal flash memory holds meta data like the contact book, calibration data and other user and non-system information.

## Bootloader (MCU)

The entire flash can be dumped using a ST-Link JTAG interface in SWD mode. This process was first described in [this github ticket](https://github.com/geary/AnyTone-D868UV/issues/59) by [bizart](https://github.com/bizart).

In the course of this ticket, multiple people published dumps of their MCU memory made with the described method.

```
srec_cat 878MCU.hex -intel -o 878MCU.bin -binary
```

A already converted version of the provided image can be [downloaded here](https://pwn.su/research/anytone/878MCU.bin). This image is a full image starting at offset 0x00. The bootloader starts at 0x8000000 and the main application at 0x8004000.

The hardware of the 868 and 878 seems that similar that a software based conversion of the device is possible. Which is also the topic of the github ticket above. A comprehensive guide how to attach the ST-Link adapter and make dumps of the device [can be found here.](https://www.spacesupport.de/digitalfunk/dmr-dmr/geraete/anytone/at868-at878/)

### Bootloader Communication

The bootloader only has four commands. 0x01, 0x02, 0x18 and UPDATE. They are detailed in [this blog post](https://do1alx.de/2022/anytone-factory-settings-mode/). There is no read command.

Example command structure (write):

| CMD Byte | Address | Data     | Checksum | ACK  |
| -------- | --------| -------- | -------- | ---  |
| 0x01     | 4 Byte  | 32 Byte  | 2 Byte   | 0x06 |

## Main Application (MCU)

Anytone firmware updates are not encrypted. They can be loaded in IDA as is. A guide how to do it can be [found here](https://do1alx.de/2022/reverse-engineering-radios-arm-binary-images-in-ida-pro/).

If you download an image from the anytone website the CDD is basically a image of the main application starting at 0x8004000. the bootloader is not included.

The firmware is all Thumb, so disable automatic mode switching. 

### Serial Protocol

The device has an interesting serial protocol. It was [detailed in this blog post](https://do1alx.de/2022/anytone-factory-settings-mode/). There is a separate communication protocol for the bootloader, and another on for the main application.

Along the normal features which are also used by the CPS, there are multiple yet unknown commands belonging to the factory (*FALTORY*) mode.

### Factory Mode

The factory mode is enabled by sending the string *FALTORY* as a serial command. This mode will enable various other serial commands which aren't well researched yet. 

## Baseband 

The device uses an SCT3258 baseband chip as it is used in multiple other devices. The vendor leaked a tool from the SDK to flash the baseband chip via USB. 

There is also a special SCT mode which allows direct communication to the baseband bootloader. More details are about this can be found in the PDF file included in the baseband update package. The package can be downloaded below.

## Linkboard (APRS and FSK)

The UVII devices contain an additional daughterboard called "linkboard" by Anytone. This board does the APRS handling and decode. Wouxon, a chinese distributor of Anytone hardware, [sold the boards as upgrade parts](http://www.wouxun.us/item.php?item_id=445).
