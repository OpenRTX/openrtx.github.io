M17 is a new digital radio protocol in development as an alternative to those currently available, with freedom in mind. Freedom in the code, protocol, voice codecs, and hardware. The goal is to provide a better option for digital radios in the future.

The OpenRTX team is collaborating with M17 team to bring M17 protocol support to OpenRTX radios.

We want to make digital voice experimentation accessible on commodity hardware.

Currently M17 is being developed on a subset of the radios supported by OpenRTX,
M17 support __requires hardware modding on all of these radios__.

## Modding

Although our current M17 supported function is a test Tx beacon, you can already
mod your radio to be able to transmit M17 with future firmware releases.
The mods for the different radios are described in the [Hardware Modding page](m17_mods.md).
